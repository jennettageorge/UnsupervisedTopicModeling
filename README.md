The purpose of this repo is to exemplify how topic modeling can be achieve on an unsupervised dataset of news articles.

The dataset is taken from the thesis of Nabeela Barbari titled `Reconsidering CVE: The Unintended Consequences of Countering Violent Extremist Efforts in America`. The aim of this project is to see if, by using NLP techniques, we can extract the same take-aways from the list of references as Nabeela did in her thesis.
